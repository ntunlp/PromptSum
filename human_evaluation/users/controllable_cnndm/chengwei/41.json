We were really fortunate that we were hit by the edge of it. \u2018It was terrifying. When we looked up and saw this thing coming... it was like out of a Hollywood movie, it was huge. \u2018We hunkered down in our tents and just prayed... The whole tent was just moving in the wind. It was incredibly terrifying. We had no idea if we were going to be ripped off the ground and flung into rocks. \u2018[Afterwards] We got out of our tents and realized we were largely OK. We immediately started looking for survivors. [Says they\u2019re doing well] \u2018We've got clean water. We've got good sanitation. We've got lots of food because we're planning to be here for a couple of months.'
