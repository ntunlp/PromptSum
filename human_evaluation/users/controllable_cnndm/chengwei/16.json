{"source": "Two college students have been charged in connection to an unconscious girl who was allegedly gang raped on a Florida beach during Spring Break in broad daylight, authorities said. Troy University students Delonte' Martistee, 22, of Georgia and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, of Alabama were charged on Friday with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators relating to the incident that occurred between March 10-12, according to Bay County Sheriff's Office. According to WFSA, it has been confirmed by university officials that both men were suspended, and Martistee, a promising track star, has been removed from the team. The alleged victim  told deputies she thought she had been drugged before the incident and that she was afraid to report it because she could not remember many details,\u00a0Panama City News Herald\u00a0reported. Scroll down for video . Delonte' Martistee, 22, (left) and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, (right) have been charged in connection with the alleged rape after police in Troy, Alabama, found the clip on a cell phone during another investigation . Martistee of Bainbridge, Georgia is a promising track star at Troy University according to officials, but he has since been removed from the team . Calhoun of Mobile, Alabama was suspended from Troy University along with Martistee, university officials confirmed . 'She knows something happened, but she doesn't know what happened,' Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said. Authorities  are still searching for two additional suspects in the case. Friday's charges stem from a video police found where hundreds of people are seen watching the incident without attempting to intervene during the alleged attack on Panama City Beach, authorities claim. The footage was uncovered on a cell phone during an unconnected investigation into a shooting in Troy, Alabama. Alerting the Bay County Sheriff's Office, the two departments worked together to identify two suspects and the alleged victim. McKeithen branded the video the 'most disgusting, sickening thing' and likened the scene to 'wild animals preying on a carcass laying in the woods'. Following the incident that occurred between March 10-12, the men were arrested and charged on Friday and were taken to the Bay County Jail as they await their first appearance . In the video, McKeithen said one man is heard in the clip saying, 'she isn't going to know,' before putting his hand inside her bikini bottoms. The incapacitated young woman is surrounded by several men while seated on a beach chair during the video filmed behind Spinnaker Beach Club. McKeithen told a press conference: 'This is happening in broad daylight with hundreds of people seeing and hearing what is happening and they are more concerned about spilling their beer than somebody being raped. 'This is such a traumatizing event for this girl. No one should have to fear this would happen in Panama City Beach, but it does.' Authorities said hundreds of people walked past but did not stop the attack near\u00a0Spinnaker Beach Club on Panama City Beach, Florida, in broad daylight during a Spring Break party last month . The sheriff's office said it has encountered incidents like this before through leads found on social media. In one video, police said a crowd pours beer on a girl who appears to be incapacitated while a male performs a sexual act on her. And recently, officers took inventory of the guns and drugs recovered during Spring Break this year which included marijuana, MDMA, cocaine, heroin as well as 49 handguns - which increased from nine last year. This most recent alleged sexual attack and the arrests made on Friday have served as a tipping point for the Bay County Sheriff's Office. McKeithen touted laws during Spring Break such as banning drinking on the beach and parking lots as well as clubs not being able to allow non-military people under 21 to enter. He said he will fight to have even more strict Spring Break regulations in the coming year. 'This draws the line in the sand for us,' he said. 'It is not safe for our children on the beach... If you condone this behavior, you should be in jail, as far as I'm concerned.' The investigation related to the incident is ongoing.", "target": "Troy University students Delonte' Martistee, 22, and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, have been charged in connection to the alleged sexual attack .
