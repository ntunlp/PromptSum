{"source": "This video shows the horrifying moment a three-legged cat was mauled to death by two savage dogs in a brutal attack. The disabled cat, called Freeman, was sitting in its front garden when the two dogs pounced, dragging the terrified cat on to its neighbour's lawn before tearing into the family pet. Police are now investigating after a person, who appears to be a woman, pulls up in a blue car and collects the hounds - leaving the cat to die in agony. Scroll down for video . Mauled to death: Two dogs tore apart a three-legged cat in a brutal attack captured on CCTV . Family pet: Freeman the cat died in the neighbour's front garden in Tarring, West Sussex, after the brutal attack . A woman (top of picture, exiting a blue car) appears to call over the dogs before walking off, leaving the disabled cat to die in agony . The 90-second attack was captured on CCTV by a neighbour who passed the footage on to the cat's owner Tracy Lynch, from Tarring, West Sussex, and the police. Ms Lynch, a 44-year-old mother-of-three, had owned the RSPCA rescue cat since 2004 and was devastated after watching the horrific video. 'To find out he had been savaged by the dogs and the owners had not done anything is just completely callous,' she said. 'That's what's most distressing for us that they didn't do anything to check on the cat. 'My youngest son was completely distraught. This is the first family pet he's lost and he was in floods of tears.' A police spokesman said the large dogs, which were running loose, were possibly Dobermans and were collected by someone who turned up in a blue car.

Ms Lynch added: 'He would go around the neighbourhood and everyone knew him. He was a real character. 'I think the neighbours will miss him out and about.'", "target": "Horrifying CCTV footage shows two dogs tearing into a three-legged cat .
