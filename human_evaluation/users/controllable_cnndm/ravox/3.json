{"source": "Bitter: Tracey Taylor went on a violent rampage following the breakdown of her 20 year relationship . A jilted florist used her car to ram her ex-fiance's Porsche as well as his new girlfriend's BMW while her two terrified daughters sat in the back. Furious Tracey Taylor, 34, caused more than \u00a313,000 worth of damage to the luxury cars including scratching the paintwork with a key and smashing the BMW's windscreen with a rock. Earlier that day she had attacked her former lover and his girlfriend, punching him on the ear and pulling her hair after barging her way into her home\u00a0in Ratby, Leics. Then two days later she returned to the property and broke in through the front door, pushing her way past her love rival's 19-year-old student daughter before tearing a flatscreen TV off the wall and hurling a vase of roses across the room. When arrested she told the police she'd attacked the cars on February 18 this year because she saw they had a Porsche and a BMW between them when he'd left her 'penniless.' Leicester Crown Court heard how Taylor had been struggling to come to terms with the breakdown of the 20 year relationship with the father of her two daughters, aged 12 and four, and a 15-year-old son. Recorder Mark Hill QC, sentencing, told Taylor, of Desford, Leics: 'You were unable to control your temper and your appalling behaviour brings discredit upon you. 'You displayed a high level of anger and violence, carried out in the presence of two young children, causing extensive and serious damage.' Lynsey Knott, defending, said: 'It was a life-long relationship since she was 15. 'She's a devoted mother, has no previous convictions, and is ashamed two of her children were present. 'She'd assisted her partner with the running of the businesses and after the breakdown was left without a home, whilst waiting for a housing association property. Taylor received a 12-month jail sentence suspended for two years, with 150 hours of unpaid work and a 20-day rehabilitation requirement . 'She was at rock-bottom and is truly sorry. Her doctor has increased her anti-depressant medication.' The court heard \u00a39,800 pounds' worth of damage was caused to the Porsche and \u00a33,800 to the BMW - including key scratch marks. Florist Taylor admitted burglary, criminal damage and two counts of common assault. She received a 12-month jail sentence suspended for two years, with 150 hours of unpaid work and a 20-day rehabilitation requirement. She was also handed a five-year restraining order was made, banning her from contacting her ex-lover's new partner or her teenage daughter. Taylor's ex-partner, aged 40, who runs a car business, asked not to be named, but said after the case: 'It's been the most stressful year of my life, since we broke up. 'It's been a complete nightmare with all the damage, threats, outbursts and driving at me before crashing into the cars in front of our daughters. 'I can't forgive what she's done and I've split up with my girlfriend, because she couldn't cope with what's happened. 'I hope this case brings an end to the problems and we can move on and work at remaining amicable for the children.'", "target": "Tracey Taylor was distraught following breakdown of 20 year relationship .
