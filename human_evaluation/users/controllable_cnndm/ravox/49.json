New mother Claire Sweeney has turned to hypnotherapist Susan Hepburn to help her shed two stone . As Claire takes to new motherhood, she has told Closer magazine that there is one pregnancy habit she's struggled to quit - her  chocolate cravings. But instead of resorting to faddy diets, Claire, who is a size 12 to 14, has said that what she really needs is to sort her binge mentality. So the actress, who is currently starring in the play Sex In Suburbia,\u00a0has sought the help of celebrity hypnotherapist Susan to curb her sweet tooth and quit her habit of snacking when she's bored. Claire said: 'I went to see a hypnotherapist last month for the first time and told her that I needed to sort out my binge mentality.' She admits she craved sugar throughout her pregnancy and couldn't kick the habit afterwards.\u00a0'I even went on a binge at a pal's birthday recently and made myself feel sick,' she said. Susan is also rumoured to have helped singer Adele quit smoking, according to the\u00a0Express. She hypnotised Claire for 20 minutes, which Claire describes as 'a bit like having a good night's sleep - it was so relaxing.' Susan Hepburn (left), who famously helped Lily Allen slim form a size 14 to an 8 (seen in 2009, right) She's only had one session so far but Claire says she can already see results. 'I saw a girl eating doughnuts and I felt sick just looking at them. I know it will take more than one session but I already feel more disciplined.' Hepburn, based on London's Harley Street, helped Lily Allen not only lose weight but bring her bulimia under control back in 2009. Leslie Barker, of the British Association of Therapeutical Hypnotists, says: 'In therapy, hypnosis involves the patient experiencing a sense of deep relaxation, with their attention focused on suggestions made by the therapist. 'These are aimed at helping people make positive changes.'
