{"source": "Andres Iniesta concedes that he has been unhappy with his form for Barcelona this season, despite receiving praise for his role in killing off Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League this week. The Spaniard played a pivotal part in setting up Neymar for the opening goal in the Catalan club's 2-0 second-leg win over PSG on Tuesday night at the Camp Nou, running from his own half before laying the ball on a plate for the Brazilian forward. Iniesta was typically modest about his fourth assist in Europe this season, preferring to focus on what has been a disappointing domestic campaign for the World Cup winner, in which he is yet to score or create a goal.

Barcelona's No 8 goes to celebrate with Neymar after killing off the French side in the opening half . 'I'm happy with the way it worked out,' Iniesta told AS\u00a0in reference to his latest assist. 'The truth is that it was a nice, fast and improvised run, but it's good that it resulted in a goal for Neymar. 'Personally, though, I think I have room for improvement. I'm unsatisfied with my form right now.' Despite Iniesta's qualms with his own personal contribution, the 30-year-old is content with how the rest of Luis Enrique's side are currently performing, with Barcelona top of La Liga by two points and adding a Champions League semi-final berth to the Copa del Rey final date with Athletic Bilbao on May 30. 'We're feeling very good going into the decisive stretch of the season,' the World Cup winner stated. 'We could have 10 games left and we will play them all with a positive attitude.' Barcelona face city rivals Espanyol at the Estadi Cornella-El Prat on Saturday looking to extend their lead at the top of La Liga, and Iniesta anticipates a difficult task at the home of their neighbours. 'I do not think that the derby is a war,' the 30-year-old added. 'But it will be a special and tough game. 'I hope things go well and we get the victory.'", "target": "Spaniard reflects on his mesmeric run and pass to set up Neymar's opener .
