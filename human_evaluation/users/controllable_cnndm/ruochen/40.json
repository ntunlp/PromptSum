{"source": "Hollywood star Robert Downey Jnr stormed out of a TV interview when asked about his history of drug abuse and time in prison. The actor was furious when the line of questioning suddenly got personal in a recorded chat with Channel 4 in  London to promote his new film Avengers: Age of Ultron. He had been on good form when the exchange started - in which, as arranged, he would discuss his experiences on the new blockbuster which premiered in Britain on Tuesday. But he could be seen getting visibly uncomfortable when interviewer Krishnan Guru-Murthy began asking about his long-conquered personal\u00a0demons. Scroll down for video . Calling time: During an interview for Avengers: Age of Ultron, Robert Downey Jnr left mid-way through . He's off: When asked about his relationship with his father, Downey Jnr gets up and says: 'I'm sorry, I really don't... what are we doing?' before walking out . 'It's all getting very Diane Sawyer in here': Robert clearly didn't appreciate the line of questioning . Didn't go according to plan, Krishnan? The Channel 4 news presenter was left visibly embarrassed . Specifically, the news anchor asked Downey Jr to explain a comment in a five year-old interview with the New York Times, in which he said: 'You can't go from a $2,000-a-night suite at La Mirage to a penitentiary and really understand it and come out a liberal.' Responding, Downey Jr, 50, said: 'I could pick that apart for two hours and be no closer to the truth than giving you some half-arsed answer right now. I couldn't even tell you what a liberal is.' But, when asked about his relationship with his father, Downey Jnr gets up and says: 'I'm sorry, I really don't... what are we doing?' before walking out of the interview. Seemingly amused with the reaction, Guru-Murthy can be seen smiling and gesticulating as a production team-member tried to remove Robert's clip-on microphone. At that point he turns and says: 'It's all getting a bit Diane Sawyer [a U.S. journalist known for her investigative interviewing].' Off to a good start: Downey Jr was charming as the exchange started - in which, as arranged, he would discuss his experiences on the new blockbuster, which premiered in London on Tuesday . Getting personal: But when Guru-Murthy asked questions about his long-conquered personal demons, the star could be seen getting visibly uncomfortable . Clearly wanting to keep a dignified silence on the matter, the veteran star - who originates from Manhattan and has battled both drug addiction and prison - resisted the temptation to make reference to the incident on Twitter. Unlike him, however, Krishnan twice shared details - captioning one video 'A steely moment from Ironman'. But viewers weren't impressed, with nearly three-hundred 'disliking' it within hours. Tellingly, the comments which followed shared a similar opinion. One wrote: 'God, Krish you can be an a--. When your interviewee is uncomfortable, don't keep pressing them. Props to RDJ for ending it.' Another simply said: 'No class at all.' Downey Jr had a period between 1996 and 2001 during which he was arrested multiple times - mostly for drug charges. Not happy: The 50 year-old actor remained professional, but was clearly upset by the random questions . This dark phase in his life culminated in 1999 when he was sentenced to three years in prison for repeatedly missing drug testing. He spent a year in California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison, before he was released in a surprise ruling. He had one other arrest in 2001 for drug possession, but has maintained a studiously clean life since then. He's mounted a massive career comeback, the crown jewel of which have been his massively successful role as egotistical billionaire superhero Tony Stark aka Iron Man. Over the course of four movies, he has grossed nearly $4billion in worldwide ticket sales. The fifth movie featuring Iron Man, Avengers: Age of Ultron, promises to be yet another box office smash. Forbes estimated that between June 2012 and June 2013 alone, he made more than $75million.

He has been praised by co-stars as a model of post-addiction focus and poise. In an interview to promote Sherlock Holmes, costar Rachel McAdams said that his efforts to stay clean are 'superheroic.' He maintains he's been entirely sober since July 2003. In interviews, he credits meditation, yoga, 12-step recovery programs and the support of his second wife, film producer Susan Downey. Last June, his son Indio was arrested on felony drug charges. When he bailed his son out of jail, Downey Jr. seemed to blame himself for his son's fall. 'Unfortunately there's a genetic component to addiction and Indio has likely inherited it.,' he said. Quentin Tarantino . Robert Downey Jr is not the first Hollywood star to be upset by Krishnan Guru-Murthy's interview technique - last year director Quentin Tarantino also objected to his line of questioning. The Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction director launched an extraordinary tirade after refusing to answer questions about movie violence. He said: 'I'm not your slave and you are not my master. You can't make me dance to your tune. I'm not a monkey.' Towards the end of the interview he rebuffed further questions on the topic, telling Guru-Murthy: 'I'm shutting your butt down.' Joan Rivers . Actress and comedienne Joan Rivers stormed off the set of a CNN interview in July last year. Rivers contended that she was there to discuss to her new book, Diary Of A Mad Diva, but was instead accused of coming across as \u2018mean\u2019 on TV show Fashion Police. She was also questioned about wearing fur when she was an animal rights activist. 'This whole interview is turning into a defensive interview,' Rivers announced. 'Are you wearing leather shoes? Then shut up,' she said. Naomi Campbell . Supermodel Naomi Campbell lost her cool and angrily knocked away a camera after being quizzed over allegations she was given a 'blood diamond' by the deposed African despot Charles Taylor. 'I didn't receive a diamond and I'm not going to speak about that,' Campbell told reporters before walking out of an interview in 2010 and punching the camera in a producer's hand. Cate Blanchett . The actress swore on national television during interview on TV program The Project in March this year. The Oscar-winning star came prepared to answer questions about her new Disney film Cinderella, but was faced with increasingly eccentric topics, including drinking beer. The exasperated actress finally reached breaking point at the end of the Q&A, when Channel Ten journalist Jonathan Hyla asked her about a cat that appeared in the fantasy flick. Turning around to look for her publicist, a confused and annoyed Blanchett fired back: 'That's your question? That's your f****** question?", "target": "Was promoting Avengers: Age of Ultron in interview for Channel 4 in UK . Hollywood star was furious when questioning suddenly became personal .
