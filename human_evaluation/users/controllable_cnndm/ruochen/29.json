{"source": "Bridget Klecker, 42, died on Friday after being struck by a vehicle fleeing the police in San Francisco . A pedestrian was killed and another injured when they were struck by a car fleeing police during a wild chase through San Francisco, and the suspects involved were still on the loose Saturday. Officers tried to stop the suspects' stolen car around 10pm on Friday just moments after they committed the latest in a series of robberies while armed with handguns, police said. But the car sped off with police in pursuit and struck a woman in a crosswalk, killing her. The San Francisco medical examiner's office identified the woman on Saturday as Bridget Klecker, 42, of San Francisco. 'I just kept saying that this can't be real \u2014 this just can't be real,' Kristine Mendoza, 35, who described Klecker as her close friend, told the San Francisco Chronicle. She and Klecker had planned to attend Monday's San Francisco Giants home opener together and were heading to Mexico in two weeks on a trip, she said. Witnesses who were riding a cable car saw the black sedan go airborne, and the windshield was badly damaged, according to KGO-TV. The car later hit a second pedestrian and then crashed into another car before slipping away from police in the South of Market neighborhood. 'It was one of those unreal experiences to see a car speeding in the intersection at us like that,' Micaela Davis, 35, a passenger in the car that was struck, told the Chronicle.
