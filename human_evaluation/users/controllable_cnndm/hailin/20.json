Klopp insisted that he has not had any contact with other clubs but confirmed that he is open to offers, denying reports that he will take a sabbatical after a difficult season in which Dortmund have struggled towards the bottom of the table. 'I am sure that the decision is absolutely right,' he said at an emotional press conference. 'This team deserves to have the absolutely one hundred per cent right coach. I believe that Borussia Dortmund actually needs a change. As long as I'm here, we are always considering the successes of the past. 'What I have always said in the last few years is that in that moment when I feel I won't be the perfect manager for this incredible club then I would say it. 'I have of course every now and then thought about the topic in past years because it is always important to question yourself. I have though in the last weeks and days asked myself if I'm still the right manager. I wasn't sure but I couldn't answer with a yes. 'I have had no contact with others clubs, either in England or elsewhere, but I am not planning a sabbatical. 'I don't think of it as a load off my shoulders. I'm not tired, even though I look like this.' Manuel Pellegrini is under pressure at Manchester City but Klopp is unlikely to replace him at the Etihad .

That would free up City's top target Guardiola to move to the Etihad and take over from Pellegrini whose future remains uncertain following a disappointing second season in English football. Neither will there be any shortage of top European clubs hoping to lure Klopp away from Germany where he has built an exciting team to challenge Bayern's dominance.
