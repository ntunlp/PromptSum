She's famous for her killer curves, but Jennifer Lopez's upper-body is as impeccably toned. A huge fitness fan, the mother of two has completed triathlons. She avoids sugar and salt and tries to get eight hours' sleep a night. She claims 'sometimes when I get home and I'm not feeling so great, I make myself go to the gym'. What to try: . Modified push-ups with your knees on the floor aren't just a cop-out for the real thing, they activate the entire upper body to get that J-Lo tone. Start on all fours with your hands on the floor, slightly wider apart than shoulder width. Slide your knees back and raise your feet off the floor until you are in a position where you can bend the elbows to drop your chest and push back up. Make sure you move the whole upper body, not just dipping your shoulders. Repeat 12 to 15 times. The singer/actress shows off toned arms at the Annual Academy Awards in February .
