{"source": "This is the incredible moment a tiger was sent crashing to the floor after mistiming an attack on a fleet-footed bird. The ferocious feline was chasing what was sure to be dinner when it slipped on the icy surface and lost its footing. As the tiger raced towards the bird, it flew directly upwards forcing the mammal to try and stop dead in its tracks. Oops-a-daisy! This tiger lots its footing in spectacular style while trying to catch a chicken at a zoo in China . On the attack: At first all was well, with the tiger homing straight in on an airborne feathery meal . Target: As the bird flew upwards the tiger began to rear up, ready to grab its prey from the air . Fail: The tiger began to slip as the bird flew higher and higher in a blind panic - and it was all caught on camera by photographer Libby Zhang . Hang time: The slip caused the tiger to flip right onto its back, with the bird now well out of reach . But momentum caused its feet to slide away from underneath and go skidding along the slippery ground. The hilarious moment took place at the Hengdaohezi Siberian Tiger Park in Northeast China and was captured by photographer Libby Zhang. Libby, from Houston in Texas, was visiting the park and photographing the tigers' feeding session.
