{"source": "Teenage Aldi worker Christian Trousedale became an internet hit after a picture of him carrying a 95-year-old pensioner's shopping home went viral . A teenage Aldi worker says he is 'blown away' by the public reaction after a picture of him carrying a 95-year-old pensioner's shopping home went viral. Christian Trousedale, 18, walked the elderly man to his front door, holding his hand as they made their way to his home in Horwich, near Bolton. His act of kindness was seen by Samantha-Jayne Brady, who stopped them to take a picture which she then posted on Facebook. The picture of Mr Trousedale and the pensioner has been 'liked' a quarter of a million times and shared by 70,000 people. It's attracted attention from all over the world, with more than 50,000 shares in\u00a0Dubai, Australia, the United States and elsewhere. Christian said he was 'blown away' by the reaction to an act of kindness that was 'just something I would normally do'. He added: 'The reaction has been completely crazy, my facebook is just overflowing with messages, I can't even start to read them all. 'One woman posted on my wall from America saying that she wished there were more people in her country like me, it has been really amazing. 'I went back into Aldi this afternoon and a lady came up and hugged me and said she loved what I had done.' Christian had spotted the 96-year-old about to make the journey alone and on foot in strong winds so asked his superiors if he could offer some help. Mr Trousedale, a college student who works part-time as a stock assistant at the supermarket, told the Bolton News\u00a0that he did not consider his actions extraordinary, and that he had been brought up to respect his elders. He said: 'I asked my manager if it was OK to walk him home and he said that was the right thing to do, so I did. 'We had a good chat about everything from the General Election to the history of Horwich - he knew lots about everything.' 'It is very strange because this is just something I would normally do, my parents have raised me to treat other people like you want to be treated yourself,' he said. The picture of Mr Trousedale and the pensioner has been 'liked' a quarter of a million times and shared by 70,000 people . Onlooker Miss Brady, who works in a fish and chip shop near the supermarket, said she posted the picture because she was taken aback by Christian's 'selfless, thoughtful and caring gesture'. She wrote: 'Need to share this, whilst working earlier we watched this lovely lad walking this little old man home. 'He wasn't very agile, nor fast but Christian walked with him ever so patiently and slowly, chatted along with him and carried his bag for him. 'It was a lovely thing to witness and they seemed to be having a good chit-chat along their way. 'High 5 to Aldi for letting him do this and high 5 to Christian from Aldi in Horwich for his selfless, thoughtful & caring gesture! 'I desperately want this lad to get some kind of recognition from his workplace so if this gave you a little more faith in mankind PLEASE share! Good people still exist.' Both Mr Trousedale, who works at the Aldi (pictured) in Horwich, near Bolton, and Miss Brady's Facebook pages have been flooded with praise . Miss Brady said she wanted to share the image and story because she feels that not enough positive stories about young people are shared around. She added: 'There are so many negative stories about young people but the positive ones just aren't seen on a large scale.' Miss Brady received a bottle of wine and a bunch of flowers from Aldi as a thank you for spreading the 18-year-old's good deed. Both Mr Trousedale and Miss Brady's Facebook pages have been flooded with praise since the photograph was taken on Friday. Among the messages of support posted online was this one from Jackie Bleszinski, who wrote: 'How lovely, glad to see there are still good people around and refreshing to hear about it instead of usual doom and gloom.' Daphne Stephens posted: 'Oh so well done - bet your parents and relations are super proud of you, I know I would be.' Mr Trouesdale's mother, Lynda, responded to the many positive comments about her son by stating: 'Thank you everyone for your kind and beautiful words, they have touched me and my husband very much. 'It's been rewarding and emotional reading people's lovely comments. We as a family are very close and me and my husband are extremely proud of our sons and how they have turned out to be.'", "target": "Christian Trousedale was seen helping elderly man home from shops .
