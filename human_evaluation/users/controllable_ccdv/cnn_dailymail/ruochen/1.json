{"source": "Gone are the days of the waif model and 'heroin chic': a new, fitter, stronger generation of women will be walking down the runway at this year's Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia. We Are Handsome will  debut their first Active Swim range on Tuesday night in Sydney and break all the rules by featuring real-life fitness and social media stars, rather than professional models. The models will include Sjana Earp,  Kate Kendall, Amanda Bisk, Juliet Burnett, and Lindy Klim. Scroll down for video . Bringing sexy back: Australian designers We Are Handsome are among the fashion houses rejecting traditional skinnier models in favour of strong, fit girls . Earp, 20, is a social media sensation famous for sharing her yoga poses with her 679,000 Instagram followers, Bisk is a former Commonwealth Games pole vaulter, sprinter and yogi, Kendall is a qualified yoga instructor and Burnett is a professional Australian Ballet dancer. We Are Handsome design duo Jeremy and Katinka Somers,  are known for pushing boundaries but believe there will be only positive reaction to their unusual model choice. 'There\u2019s a big thing about \"who should be on the runway\" so we know we\u2019re breaking rules by having girls that have never been on a catwalk before (and who are nervous about it),' Katinka told Daily Mail Australia. Strong beats skinny: We Are Handsome will debut fit, real girls (including Instagram sensation Sjana Earp, pictured) at launch of their Active Swim range on Tuesday night in Sydney . Bolt like Bisk: Amanda Bisk, who is the ultimate fit trifecta, (yogi, pole vaulter and sprinter), will also walk the runway show today . Beach to backstage: Bisk achieves her slim frame through healthy exercise . 'But the rules are there to be broken, times have changed and girls who are active are the new shape. Strong really is the new sexy.' Casting healthy girls is crucial  to the designers who believe   largely represent their brand and  promote the active philosophy they value. 'We will not cast skinny models or skeletal frames, we look for real, active and healthy women - and  not just with the fit girls but for our catwalk models too,' says Katinka. Waif goes wayward: Australian designers ditch skeletal frames, following France's law to ban skinny models . En pointe: Ballet dancer Juliet Burnett will feature as one of the fit girls in the We Are Handsome show . Jeremy admits personality comes into it too. 'We're authentic, fun and outgoing so it's about making people feel good and having girls that purvey that.' 'A lot of the girls (fitness models) are very big on Instagram and encourage people to follow in their active foot steps, so we have chosen experienced yogis, a ballerina, a sprinter and pole vaulter and people who embody healthy eating too,' says Jeremy. On how the industry will take their bold choice, the We Are Handsome couple aren't worried. Klim-spiration: Lindy Klim, pictured wearing a We Are Handsome swimsuit, will also walk the runway . 'We have friends who are competitors, but we don\u2019t design for other designers, we design for ourselves and the We Are Handsome woman,' says Jeremy. 'We're also not shunning skinny women,' adds Katinka. 'There are lots of women out there that no matter what they eat, won\u2019t be a robust shape. We're just aiming for a different shape of women to other designers.' This industry first in Australia comes only days after  France passed legislation banning excessively thin models from participating in Paris Fashion Week. Aspirational athlete: Kate Kendall, co-owner of  gym Flow Athletic will host a yoga class and walk the runway . Agents and fashion houses who hire the models could  face fines under the new law, which was passed on April 3. 'We're also not shunning skinny women,' adds Katinka. 'There are lots of women out there that no matter what they eat, won\u2019t be a robust shape. We're just aiming for a different shape of women to other designers.' This industry first in Australia comes only days after  France passed legislation banning excessively thin models from participating in Paris Fashion Week. Social media star: Sjana Earp, fitness blogger and avid yogi will star in the We Are Handsome show . This self-regulated approach has also been taken by new Australian brand Robb & Lulu who cast healthy, Instagram sensation Renee Somerfield for their debut collection. 'After the collection went live online yesterday we had great consumer and industry feedback,' says Sian Vandermuelen who represents the label. 'They loved that we were using a woman that wasn't a typical sample size and who is comfortable in her own skin.' Crave comfort: Robb & Lulu have found women like seeing models who are comfortable in their own skin . Leading the way in size range too, Robb & Lulu have chosen to make resort wear that goes from size 0 up to 26 and swimwear that includes bigger cup sizes too, with cups sizes going up to a double F. 'Lulu found there was a gap in market and she needed to design for women that are bigger and bustier and people that were able to feel empowered and comfortable in a bigger bikini or kaftan.' And the proof is in the demand, with British Vogue already catching wind of the label's range and requesting stock from them based on their fits and ability to suit all bodies and sizes. Australian designer Manning Cartell have also taken a stance, with all 39 women on their runway being size 8-10 models this season. Bikini babe: Social media star Renee Somerfield was chosen to launch Robb & Lulu's first collection . Push for plus: Australian label Robb and Lulu have had great response to 0-26 size range and FF cup sizes . 'We always try and select healthy strong girls so it\u2019s always been a focus for us,' says Gabrielle Manning, as reported in The Daily Telegraph. Additionally Bondi Bather has refused 'too-skinny models' during castings with designer Kerry Cusack reporting back to modelling agencies that she is after healthy, Aussie girls and believes its a responsibility designers need to guard to stop young girls body image issues. As for We Are Handsome, alongside the fit models, a  yoga class held by Kate Kendall (yoga teacher and one of the models walking) will commence prior to the runway show to energise the models and instil the healthy message of the brand before the show.", "target": "Designers We Are Handsome, Manning Cartell and Bondi Bather turn away from using skinny models .
