{"source": "A barrister and Oxford University graduate who spent more than two years avoiding paying for his train ticket could be the biggest fare-dodger to be prosecuted, a court heard. Peter Barnett, 43, is said to have caused a loss of \u00a323,000 to Chiltern Railways over a two-and-a-half year period. He travelled from his Oxfordshire home to London Marylebone but pretended to have only gone from Wembley, in north west London. Peter Barnett, 43, is said to have caused a loss of \u00a323,000 to Chiltern Railways over two-and-a-half years . Barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between April 2012 and November last year . The Australian-born lawyer argues that he only dodged up to \u00a39,714.40 in fares, claiming the amount should be based on the cost of a weekly ticket, and take into account annual leave. But prosecutor Malachy Pakenham told Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'If it is accepted that the loss was \u00a323,000, this defendant would be convicted of the biggest rail evasion case that has come to the court in the United Kingdom. 'The Crown have reached that figure by a number of rail staff calculating it. 'The train company are experts, not me or my friend and they have calculated it on a basis that if someone commits a fraud like this defendant has committed, you are not allowed to calculate it on the basis of a weekly ticket, you calculate it on a full single fare, of the return for the day, each and every day this defendant travelled over the period without a full price rail ticket'. Barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between April 2012 and November last year. Barnett claimed to have\u00a0travelled from Wembley, in North West London, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire . The scam began to unravel for Barnett when he was stopped by a ticket inspector at Marylebone last November. The Rhodes scholar claimed to have travelled from Wembley, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire, where he and his wife live in a \u00a3550,000 five-bedroom detached home. Barnett was sent to the excess fares window but another member of staff became suspicious and decided to contact his supervisor. When he turned his back Barnett ran away, but was apparently overcome with guilt and confessed the next day. An investigation was carried out by British Transport Police, which found the lawyer had dodged fares since April 2012. The lawyer was cautioned for an identical offence in 2010 but continued to break the law, despite his prestigious reputation as the founder of an African children's charity and director of leading think-tank, the Legatum Institute Foundation, aimed at 'promoting prosperity'. A court heard how the barrister got off at London Marylebone (pictured) by tapping out with an Oyster card . It is understood he did so by boarding a train at Haddenham and Thame Parkway without a ticket, and then getting off at Marylebone by simply tapping out with an Oyster card. Because there was no start point to his journey, the automated system charged him the maximum Transport for London fare, which is currently \u00a37.60. But this is still far less than the \u00a319.80 price of a single peak time journey from his home. The case was adjourned until July 27 so a hearing can be held to determine the loss caused to Chiltern Railways. Barnett was released on unconditional bail. The deception places him among the ranks of Britain's biggest fare dodgers, closely behind a former millionaire fund manager. Jonathan Burrows was banned from working in the City last year after avoiding \u00a343,000 in train fares from his home in Stonegate, East Sussex. Burrows had hoped to keep his name out of the public eye and avoid prosecution by quickly reimbursing Southeastern trains the full amount in unpaid tickets, accrued over five years, within three days of being caught.", "target": "Peter Barnett, 43, travelled from Haddenham and Thame to Marylebone .
