{"source": "A Kamo Hovhannisyan own goal set them on their way, with Ledian Memushaj adding a second from a free-kick and Armando Sadiku tapping home a third. The win means Albania leapfrog Denmark into second place in Group I. Portugal - who had already qualified as group winners - won 2-1 against Serbia, who had two men sent off. Manchester City's Aleksandar Kolarov was shown two yellow cards and Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic was given a straight red for violent conduct after taking a frustrated swipe at Portugal's Andre Andre. Portugal rested captain Cristiano Ronaldo for the game in Serbia, having already secured top spot in Group I and qualification with a game to spare. Ronaldo's former Manchester United team-mate Luis Nani gave them an early lead with a left-foot finish, but Zoran Tosic equalised for Serbia with a powerful first-time strike in the second half. Substitute Joao Moutinho scored Portugal's winner with a shot from the edge of the box 12 minutes from the end. Albania's win means Denmark finish third in the group, and will face a play-off to qualify for France next summer. Match ends, Armenia 0, Albania 3. Second Half ends, Armenia 0, Albania 3.
